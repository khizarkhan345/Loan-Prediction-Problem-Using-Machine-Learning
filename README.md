# Loan-Prediction-Problem-Using-Machine-Learning
Initially i solved the loan prediction problem using Logistic Regression in R. Then i moved to Python and did some analysis. I applied several
algorithms on the dataset and recorded the accuracies of each model. Then i performed some feature selection, outlier detection and removals and
hyperparameters tuning to improve the accuracy of each algorithm. Below is the table of accuracies.

Algorithm	Accuracy (%) before feature engineering etc.	Accuracy (%) after feature engineering etc.	Change in Accuracy (%)
Logistic Regression	      68.56	                                   81.65	                                 13.09
Support Vector Classifier	79.50                                  	 81.83	                                    2.33
Decision Tree Classifier	80.13	                                   80	                                     -0.13
Random Forest Classifier	78.83	                                   80.55	                                  1.72
