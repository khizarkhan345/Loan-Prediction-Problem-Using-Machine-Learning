# Loan-Prediction-Problem-Using-Machine-Learning
Initially i solved the loan prediction problem using Logistic Regression in R. Then i moved to Python and did some analysis. I applied several
algorithms on the dataset and recorded the accuracies of each model. Then i performed some feature selection, outlier detection and removals and
hyperparameters tuning to improve the accuracy of each algorithm. Below is the table of accuracies.

Algorithm	                                 Accuracy (%) before feature engineering etc.
Logistic Regression	                                  68.56	                                  
Support Vector Classifier	                            79.50                      
Decision Tree Classifier	                            80.13	              
Random Forest Classifier	                            78.83	                                   

Algorithm	Accuracy (%)                     Accuracy (%) after feature engineering etc
